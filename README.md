ArcRasterRescue
===============

**Seeking someone knowledgeable in the ways of crafting GDAL drivers to help with that part of the effort.**

The enclosed program extracts (rescues!) raster data from an ArcGIS File
Geodatabase into a GeoTIFF file.

List the numbers and names of rasters in the geodatabase using

    ./arc_raster_rescue.exe <path/to/geodatabase.gdb/>

Extract to a GeoTIFF using

    ./arc_raster_rescue.exe <path/to/geodatabase.gdb/> <RASTER NUM> <OUTPUT FILE>

The geodatabase path must end with a slash!

Requirements
============

* [C++11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11)
* [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/)
* [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/)
* [Cmake](https://cmake.org/)

On an Ubuntu/Debian system you can obtain these with:

    sudo apt install cmake libgdal-dev zlib1g-dev g++

Compilation
===========

To compile use the standard cmake sequence:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..
    make

Add `-DEXPLORE=ON` to print additional information useful for development to
stderr as the program runs.

An executable called `arc_raster_rescue.exe` is produced.

TODO
====

 * **Turn this into a GDAL driver.**
 * Improve endian checking.
 * Check for other kinds of compressions.
 * Improve calculation of raster dimensions.
 * Improve geotransform calculations: they're kind of experimental at the moment.
 * Switch some identification strings to ENUM values so things run quicker


Credits
=======

* Even Rouault did much of the work figuring out the FileGeodatabase specification. His notes are [here](https://github.com/rouault/dump_gdbtable/wiki/FGDB-Spec) and a program he wrote for extracting FGDB data is [here](https://github.com/rouault/dump_gdbtable).

* James Ramm did some exploratory work that resulted in determining that the raster data (at least in cases he tested) had been compressed using zlib. ([Link](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2016-July/044761.html))

* Richard Barnes converted code by Even Rouault into C++ as a base for Arc Raster Rescue and, starting from some notes by James Ramm, continued deciphering the format. He reorganized the code extensively to increase its modularity, determined how to connect the various raster tables together, drafted geotransform and WKT projection extraction capabilities, determined how data types were specified, and produced a working executable to extract raster data into GeoTIFFs. He also wrote this paragraph. :-)
